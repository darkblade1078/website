title: How to add routes

First we create a new folder called `routes` in the `src` directory. And make a new file `hello-world.get` or `hello-world.post` if you want a post route.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Route } from '@sapphire/plugin-api';

export class UserRoute extends Route {
	public run(request: Route.Request, response: Route.Response) {
		response.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
	}
}
```

A quick glance on what we did above:

- First we extended the `Route` class to make our route
- Second we inherited the `run` method from the `Route` class
- Finally we responded to the request with a message which we would be able to use later when we fetch the route
